This project is a fun interactive webpage where a rectangle changes its background color based on your mouse position. When you move your mouse over the rectangle, the left side gradually turns green, and the right side transitions to blue, depending on where the cursor is. Once you move your mouse out, the rectangle resets to white. The animations are powered by GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for smooth and visually appealing transitions.
