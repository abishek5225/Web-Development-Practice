This project creates a fun effect where images follow your mouse as you move over a specific area (#center). To keep the effect smooth and fast, a throttle function is used to control how often the images appear. When you move the mouse, a small box with an image is created at the cursor's position and disappears after 1.4 seconds. The throttle function ensures that images are added only once every 400 milliseconds, making the animation efficient and reducing lag.
